Changelog for Writer2LaTeX version 1.2 -> 1.4

---------- version 1.3.1 alpha ----------

[w2x] New boolean option use_svg (default false): If export format is HTML5 vector graphics are exported as inline SVG, if possible

  The converter creates polyglot HTML5 documents, i.e. documents will be conforming to HTML5 as well as XML standards.

  are now avoided)

[all] API change: The converters can now convert directly from a DOM tree

[all] Removed unused code in writer2latex.xmerge

[w2x] Moved localized strings to .properties files
